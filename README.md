[This project is dead]

Requires AutoHotKey v1.1 installed on your system

Download it from here: https://www.autohotkey.com/

When you download the macro file, extract all and open the "AutoFish.ahk" file

The macro contains two tabs:
- one to view macro status
- another for configuring the white pixel check on the "keep tapping to reel" text

YouTube demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eek5bOYt9-c
Set-up instructions will be shown when you first start up

For whatever reason the main script isn't in a separate folder when you download, please put it in one so the config file created when you first exit the macro saves in the same directory.

Future plans:
- I am working on disconnect detection but it is a lot of work. Preston has system in place to try making macros hard as possible to setup so give me some more time.
